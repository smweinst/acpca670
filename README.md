# acpca670
This R package is for my final project for BSTA 670 (Programming and Computation for Biomedical Data Science, Spring 2020 semester). The R package allows one to replicate and extend some of the simulations from the 2016 AC-PCA paper by Lin et al. [1]

To install this package in R:
```
devtools::install_github("smweinst/acpca670/acpca670_package")
```
