# acpca670
This R package is for my final project for BSTA 670 (Programming and Computation for Biomedical Data Science, Spring 2020 semester). The R package allows one to replicate some of the simulations from the 2016 AC-PCA paper by Lin et al. [1] The R package also allows one to assess performance of the AC-PCA method when the loadings obtained from AC-PCA in one sample are applied to a new sample.
