\title{Function to simulate data and compare different methods}
\usage{
sim_compare_fun(n = 5, b = 10, p = 400, alpha = 2.5, nsim = 100, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of subjects; default is 5}

\item{b}{the number of brain regions; default is 10}

\item{p}{the number of features per brain region; default is 400}

\item{alpha}{the constant that is multiplied by the confounder; default is 2.5}

\item{nsim}{number of simulations to run; default is 100}

\item{plot}{indicating whether to plot results comparison; default is TRUE}
}
\description{
Data will be simulated using sim_dat_fun function and then we will compare performance of ComBat, SVA, and acPCA, just like in the AC-PCA paper
